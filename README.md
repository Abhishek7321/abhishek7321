I am a 22-year-old Computer Science and Engineering student based in Dehradun, blending a strong academic foundation with real-world industry experience. For the past half-year, I've been actively freelancing as a full-stack developer, delivering production-ready websites for corporate clients. I'm highly passionate about building scalable web applications and developing software that bridges the gap between technology and financial markets.

### 👨‍💻 About Me

* 🎓 **Education:** Final-year B.Tech Computer Science & Engineering.
* 💼 **Experience:** 5+ months as a Freelance Full-Stack Web Developer managing client projects end-to-end.
* 📈 **Interests:** Forex trading (specifically XAUUSD) and quantitative market analysis. 
* 🏋️‍♂️ **Off-screen:** When I'm not on my MacBook coding or analyzing charts, I'm hitting a double muscle split at the gym!

### 🚀 What I'm Currently Working On

* **Advanced Forex Analytics Platform:** Developing a comprehensive web application for real-time forex market analysis, featuring integrated charting tools and live financial news feeds.
* **BestElectricScooty.com:** Building an affiliate platform dedicated to electric scooters, a niche inspired by my family's business, Abhika Motors Pvt. Ltd.
* **Freelance Projects:** Continuing to build and deploy tailored web solutions for various business clients.
